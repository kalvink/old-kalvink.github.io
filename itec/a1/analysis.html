According to the Market Analysis Survey located below, this new information <br>
has influenced the design of the website drastically.The website is made to <br>
reflect a restaurant as Global Dining serves food to customers of any age, <br>
gender, income, and education. I chose a standard neutral design and page color <br>
as they aren't specifically targeting any type of demographic. I made sure to<br>
include plenty of photos of their best selling take out dishes for customers to <br>
order. I made sure to make the photos big to allow the customers to capture the <br>
quality just by looking at it. I've chosen family friendly images for the homepage<br>
because this is a restaurant for all ages.
